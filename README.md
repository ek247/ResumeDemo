# ResumeDemo
A simple webapp with the Spring-boot framework that allows a user to input information and spits out a pre-templated PDF resume.

It uses Spring-Boot as the web framework with thymeleaf as the templating engine and javascript for basic scripting stuff in the front end.
It also uses itext for pdf editing.
